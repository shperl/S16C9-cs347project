/          -=(  COMPLY WITH STANDARDS WHEN CHANGING MESSAGES  )=-
/
/
/ Message Standards
/ =================
/ Content taken from Oracle RDBMS message standards
/ Original content written 07/28/92
/
/ Purpose
/ -------
/   When a message is generated, you are speaking directly to the user.  Often,
/ the quality of your software is judged by the ease with which a user can fix
/ problems.  Your purpose is to make it as easy as possible to use Oracle
/ products.
/
/   Note that the "Cause:" and "Action:" sections for a message will also be
/ seen by the user.  Thus, it is important to keep these sections simple, yet
/ as helpful as possible.
/
/   Whenever possible, include all relevant information within the message.
/
/   Your purpose is to make a message as informative as possible.
/
/ Size Of Message
/ ---------------
/   Message text should be limited to a maximum of 76 characters. Messages
/ containing embedded {parm] directives should not overrun the 76 character limit
/ unless they signal unusual errors which do not occur as part of user
/ applications.  For example, startup errors and system-dependent errors can
/ probably may have longer message text.
/
/
/ Simple Language
/ ---------------
/   Avoid cryptic messages and overly technical language.
/
/     NOT GOOD: index key does not exist root dba {0}, dba {1} ({2})
/     BETTER  : index key does not exist for row: {0}, {1}, {2}
/
/
/ Lowercase vs. Uppercase
/ -----------------------
/   Use uppercase for commands and keywords.
/
/     NOT GOOD: alter cluster statement no longer supported
/     BETTER  : ALTER CLUSTER statement no longer supported
/
/
/   Use lowercase in the message wording, including the first letter.
/
/     NOT GOOD: Invalid syntax
/     BETTER  : invalid syntax
/
/
/ Commands, Keywords, Parameters Values
/ -------------------------------------
/   Whenever possible, give the command, keyword, and parameter values that the
/ user used.
/
/   Use uppercase to indicate commands and keywords.
/
/     NOT GOOD: missing IDENTIFIED keyword
/     BETTER  : GRANT CONNECT statement requires the IDENTIFIED keyword
/
/     NOT GOOD: MAXVALUE is less than current value
/     BETTER  : ALTER SEQUENCE MAXVALUE %s is less than current MAXVALUE %s
/
/
/ Period
/ ------
/   Do not end a message with a period.
/
/
/ Numbers
/ -------
/   Do not enclose numbers with special characters.
/
/     NOT GOOD: number of control files ({0}) does not equal {1}
/     BETTER  : specified {0} control files while other instances have {1}
/
/   Spell out the word "number" to ensure the message is understood.
/
/     NOT GOOD: change {0} for thread ({1}) is in sequence #{2}
/     BETTER  : the change number {0} for thread {1} is in sequence number {2}
/
/
/ Numbers - User Input
/ --------------------
/   Do not enclose user-input numbers with special characters.
/
/     NOT GOOD: file size ({0}) exceeds maximum of {1} blocks
/     BETTER  : a file size of {0} would exceed the allowed maximum of {1} blocks
/
/
/ Quotes
/ ------
/   Do not use single or double quotes to highlight a text variable or command.
/
/     NOT GOOD: 'row_locking = always' requires transaction processing
/     BETTER  : ROW_LOCKING = ALWAYS requires transaction processing
/
/
/ Single Quotes
/ -------------
/   Never use single quotes.
/
/
/ Double Quotes
/ -------------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use double quotes to identify database objects.
/
/     NOT GOOD: file {0}: bad block size "% bytes" expecting "{1}"
/     BETTER  : expected block size of {0} bytes in file "{1}" but found {2}
/
/     NOT GOOD: duplicate column {0}
/     BETTER  : duplicate column "{0}" specified for table "{1}", schema "{2}"
/
/
/ Ellipses
/ --------
/   Never use ellipses.
/
/     NOT GOOD: datatype {{0}} for column {1}, table {2}.{3} is not supported
/     BETTER  : datatype {0} not support for column "{1}" table "{2}" schema "{3}"
/
/
/ Parentheses
/ -----------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use parentheses for identifying constraint names.
/
/     NOT GOOD: unique constraint {0}.{1} violated
/     BETTER  : unique constraint ({0}.{1}) violated
/
/     NOT GOOD: invalid file size ({0})
/     BETTER  : size of {0} bytes is invalid for file "{1}"
/
/
/ Brackets
/ --------
/   ALWAYS and ONLY use brackets for identifying program argument values.
/
/     NOT GOOD: Internal Error: {0},{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6}
/     BETTER  : internal error, arguments: [{0}],[{1}],[{2}],[{3}],[{4}],[{5}]
/
/
/ Grammar
/ ------
/    Use complete sentences whenever possible (but no period at end of
/ sentence).
/
/    Use not use multiple sentences in a message, i.e. one sentence only.
/
/    Use the active voice.
/
/    Do not use an antagonistic tone.
/
/    Use correct punctuation whenever possible.
/
/
/ Recommended Style
/ ---------------------
/   Try to make positive recommendations or suggestions as part of the message.
/
/   Explain what is invalid AND what is valid.
/
/     NOT GOOD: invalid file size ({0})
/     BETTER  : file size of {0} is invalid
/     BEST    : file size of {0} bytes is outside valid range {1} to {2} bytes
/
/     NOT GOOD: duplicate column {0}
/     GOOD    : duplicate column "{0}" in {1}
/     BEST    : duplicate column "{0}" in {1} "{2}"
/                                        ^    ^
/                        this variable ...    ... this variable
/                   indicates the TYPE            indicates the NAME
/                   of database object            of the object
/
/
/   Thus, substituting ... 'colin', 'view'
/
/        in:    duplicate column "{0}" in {1}
/     gives:    duplicate column "colin" in view
/
/
/   And, substituting ... 'ugotit', 'primary, foreign or index key'
/
/        in:    duplicate column "{0}" in {1}
/     gives:    duplicate column "ugotit" in primary, foreign or index key
/
/   And, substituting ... 'pedestal', 'table', 'entablature'
/
/        in:    duplicate column "{0}" in {1} "{2}"
/     gives:    duplicate column "pedestal" in table "entablature"
/
/   And substituting ... 'wat', 'dee', 'dikins'
/
/        in:    illegal constraint ({0}.{1}) for schema "{2}"
/     gives:    illegal constraint (wat.dee) for schema "dikins"
/
/
/ Text Variables
/ --------------
/   Do not place text variables at the beginning of messages, as this does not
/ allow correct alphabetical sorting of the messages.  The alphabetical listing
/ at the back of the Messages Manual is a necessary tool for Customer Support.
/
/     NOT GOOD: {0} not found
/     BETTER  : object {1} not found
/     BEST    : object {0} not found in schema {1}
/
/
/ Internal Errors & Routine Names
/ -------------------------------
/   Use ORA-00600 messages for internal messages not to be seen by the user.
/
/   Do not use routine names in messages.
/
/     NOT GOOD: NoSQL-03116, ttcxxx: invalid buffer length
/     BETTER  : NoSQL-00600, internal error, arguments: [ttcxxx], [], [], [], []
/
/
/ Public vs. Non Public Messages
/ ------------------------------
/   Use NoSQL-00600 messages for internal messages not to be seen by the user.
/
/   For messages which are for internal use only, indicate this in ERROR.MSGS
/ message listing or at beginning of the range of this type of message in the
/ file. Debug event codes, CORE messages, are examples.
/
/   Use "// *Document: NO" as follows:
/
/   e.g.
/       10049, 00000, "protect library cache memory heaps"
/       // *Document: NO
/       // *Cause:
/       // *Action: Use the OS memory protection (if available) to protect
/       //          library cache memory heaps that are pinned.
/
/
/ Programmer's Comments
/ ---------------------
/   If you wish to add comments regarding a message that should not be seen by
/ the public, use "// *Comment: " as follows:
/
/   e.g.
/       32769, 00000, "incompatible SQL*Net version"
/       // *Cause: An attempt was made to use an older version of SQL*Net that
/       //         is incompatible with current version of ORACLE.
/       // *Action: Use a newer version of SQL*Net.
/       // *Comment: Can only happen if user tried to use an illegal copy of a
/       //           pre-lease version of SQL*Net.
/
/
/ ORACLE vs. Oracle
/ -----------------
/    The word ORACLE in uppercase refers to the ORACLE server. Use the term
/ "ORACLE server" when referring to the server.
/
/    The word Oracle in lowercase with capitalized first letter refers to the
/ company. Use "Oracle Corp." when referring to the company.

/
/ Adding an error:
/   Check out this file, add the error, and check it back in.
/   Error numbers should always be ordered.
/   The second column should always be x00000.
